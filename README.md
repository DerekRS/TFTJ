# TFTJ

This is conceived as an exploration of choosing the "tool for the job." Each project here will be a simple application, and will
be implemented multiple times using different languages and tools. The goal is to get insight into the pros, cons, and opportunities that  come with the choice of tools. 

We expect that for each project there may not be a best tool for the job, but that some tols will be clearly better than others.
